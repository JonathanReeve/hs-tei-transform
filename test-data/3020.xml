               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>It seemed that out of battle I escaped </l>
                  <l>Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped </l>
                  <l>Through granites which titanic wars had groined. </l>
                  <l>Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned, </l>
                  <l>Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred. </l>
                  <l>Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared </l>
                  <l>With piteous recognition in fixed eyes, </l>
                  <l>Lifting distressful hands as if to bless. </l>
                  <l>And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall, </l>
                  <l>By his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell. </l>
                  <l>With a thousand pains that vision's face was grained; </l>
                  <l>Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground, </l>
                  <l>And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan. </l>
                  <l>“Strange friend,” I said, “here is no cause to mourn.” </l>
                  <l>“None,” said that other, “save the undone years, </l>
                  <l>The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours, </l>
                  <l>Was my life also; I went hunting wild </l>
                  <l>After the wildest beauty in the world, </l>
                  <l>Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair, </l>
                  <l>But mocks the steady running of the hour, </l>
                  <l>And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here. </l>
                  <l>For of my glee might many men have laughed, </l>
                  <l>And of my weeping something had been left, </l>
                  <l>Which must die now. I mean the truth untold, </l>
                  <l>The pity of war, the pity war distilled. </l>
                  <l>Now men will go content with what we spoiled, </l>
                  <l>Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled. </l>
                  <l>They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress. </l>
                  <l>None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress. </l>
                  <l>Courage was mine, and I had mystery, </l>
                  <l>Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery: </l>
                  <l>To miss the march of this retreating world </l>
                  <l>Into vain citadels that are not walled. </l>
                  <l>Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels, </l>
                  <l>I would go up and wash them from sweet wells, </l>
                  <l>Even with truths that lie too deep for taint. </l>
                  <l>I would have poured my spirit without stint <pb n="36"/>
                              </l>
                  <l>But not through wounds; not on the cess of war. </l>
                  <l>Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were. </l>
                  <l>I am the enemy you killed, my friend. </l>
                  <l>I knew you in this dark: for so you frowned </l>
                  <l>Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed. </l>
                  <l>I parried; but my hands were loath and cold. </l>
                  <l>Let us sleep now....” </l>

                  <l>But where the lamb for this burnt-offering? </l>
                  <l>Then Abram bound the youth with belts and straps, </l>
                  <l>And builded parapets and trenches there, </l>
                  <l>And stretchèd forth the knife to slay his son. </l>
                  <l>When lo! an angel called him out of heaven, </l>
                  <l>Saying, Lay not they hand upon the lad, </l>
                  <l>Neither do anything to him. Behold, </l>
                  <l>A ram, caught in a thicket by its horns; </l>
                  <l>Offer the Ram of Pride instead of him. </l>
